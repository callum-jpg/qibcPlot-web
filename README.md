## What is qibcPlot?
qibcPlot aims to offer users an easy way of generating 3-variable scatter plots from Cellprofiler output data. Specifically, this R script was created to allow for the visualisation of DNA damage markers at specific stages of the cell cycle on a dataset that examined >1,000 individual cells per condition.
